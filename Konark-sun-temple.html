            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Konark Sun Temple, also known as the Black Pagoda, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of India’s most magnificent architectural wonders. Built in the 13th century CE in Konark, Odisha, this temple is dedicated to Surya, the Sun God. It represents the zenith of Kalinga architecture and was constructed by King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Historical Background</h2>
            <p>Built in 1250 CE by King Narasimhadeva I (1238–1264 CE), the temple symbolizes the power and artistic excellence of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It is designed as a massive chariot of the Sun God, pulled by seven horses and having 24 intricately carved wheels. Over time, the main sanctum collapsed, but the remaining structures still showcase the architectural brilliance of the temple.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Architectural Brilliance</h2>
            <h3>1. Chariot Structure</h3>
            <p>The entire temple is shaped like a gigantic chariot of Surya, with seven horses symbolizing the seven days of the week and 24 massive wheels, each around 12 feet in diameter, representing the 24 hours of a day. The wheels function as sundials, which can tell time accurately when sunlight falls on them.</p>
            <h3>2. The Main Temple (Sanctum) - Now in Ruins</h3>
            <p>The original main sanctum (Garbhagriha) once stood over 200 feet high, but it collapsed over time. The remaining Jagamohana (assembly hall) and Natamandira (dance hall) showcase the grandeur of the original temple.</p>
            <h3>3. Sculptural Marvels</h3>
            <p>The temple is adorned with intricate stone carvings, depicting mythological stories, celestial beings (Apsaras and Gandharvas), war scenes, daily life of people, and erotic sculptures similar to those of Khajuraho. The carvings also highlight scientific precision, including astronomical and mathematical concepts.</p>
            <h3>4. The Magnetic Effect (Legend)</h3>
            <p>It is believed that the temple originally had a lodestone (magnet) at the top, which caused ships navigating the Bay of Bengal to get diverted. This led to the removal of the lodestone by the British or Portuguese, weakening the structure and leading to its collapse.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Symbolism & Spiritual Significance</h2>
            <p>The temple represents the cycle of time and the passage of life through its chariot design. The seven horses symbolize the seven rays of the Sun that guide life on Earth. The Sun God was worshipped as the ultimate source of energy and power in ancient times.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Current Status & Preservation</h2>
            <p>The Konark Sun Temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has undertaken conservation efforts to preserve the temple. The annual Konark Dance Festival celebrates the rich cultural heritage of Odisha in front of the temple.</p>
