        <p>A Detailed Overview</p>

        <section id="historical-background">
            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>The Sanchi Stupa was originally commissioned by Emperor Ashoka (Maurya Dynasty) in 3rd century BCE. Ashoka embraced Buddhism after the Kalinga War and initiated the construction of several stupas across India to spread Buddhist teachings. The original structure was a simple brick dome but was later expanded and decorated by rulers of the Shunga, Satavahana, and Gupta dynasties.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="architectural-features">
            <h2>Architectural Features</h2>
            <h3>1. The Stupa Structure</h3>
            <p>The stupa is a hemispherical dome representing the cosmic mound of the universe. It is 35 meters (115 feet) in diameter and 16 meters (52 feet) high. The dome is surrounded by a circular path (pradakshina) for circumambulation, which is an important ritual in Buddhism. 

<h3>2. The Toranas</h3>
<p>Four ornate gateways (toranas) mark the cardinal points and are adorned with intricate carvings depicting various Jataka tales and scenes from the life of Buddha. These gateways are significant examples of early Indian art and architecture.</p>

<h3>3. The Harmika</h3>
<p>At the top of the stupa is the harmika, a square railing symbolizing the abode of the gods. Above the harmika, there is a chhatra, a parasol-like structure that represents the protection and honor given to the Buddha.</p>

<section id="symbolism">
    <h2>Symbolism in the Carvings</h2>
    <p>The carvings on the toranas and the stupa itself are rich in symbolism, representing various aspects of Buddhist philosophy. The lotus flower, for instance, symbolizes purity and enlightenment, while the wheel (Dharmachakra) represents the teachings of Buddha.</p>
